# Handling the SOC2 audit

Honestly not a bad job as long as you stay organized and continuously track evidence. It's gotten a bit harder after compliance restricted access to older slack messages and emails, but not impossible.

### Evidence to track throughout the year
- Make sure the team is announcing their releases throughout the year
- Make sure partners are aware of the frontend releases slack channel
- Make sure that all ceremonial meetings (standup, audit meeting) have descriptive email invites and minutes are kept in Google Drive for the audit meeting
- Take screenshots monthly of important slack channels that you might need for evidence

### Evidence to review before the audit
- Make any necessary revisions to the network/data flow diagrams before the audit begins
   - This is the first thing that auditors look at
- Perform the tabletop exercise with the entire team.
   - Make sure to remind the team to review the disaster recovery plan
